This is the about my personal page, here you will found articles and personal hobbies, for example develop. ✨</br>
</br>
I have completed my coursework in Computer Science and Systems Engineering. Currently pursuing a master's degree focused on data analysis, I learn to develop in many languages; the languages I already have the most knowledge of are JavaScript/TypeScript and Java. I like math as I also like to solve all kinds of developmental and logical problems.</br>
</br>
I am passionate about studying and working with emerging technologies, particularly in AI. I have completed several online courses in this field and am eager to contribute my knowledge and experience in a dynamic environment that fosters continued growth.</br>
